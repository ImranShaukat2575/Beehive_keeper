# HiveKeeper — Beehive Management Calculator

## What Is It?

HiveKeeper is a free, browser-based beehive management calculator built for beekeepers of all experience levels. Whether you're managing a single backyard hive or running a small apiary, HiveKeeper gives you the data-driven insights you need to make confident decisions about your colonies — without needing expensive software or a beekeeping degree.

The tool runs entirely in your browser with no sign-up, no downloads, and no data sent anywhere. Just open it and start calculating.

## How It Works

HiveKeeper is organised into five specialised calculators, each targeting a critical area of hive management:

### 🏠 Colony Health Calculator
Input the number of brood frames, adult bee frames, queen status, varroa mite count, capped brood percentage, and colony temperament. HiveKeeper estimates your total adult bee population (based on the standard 2,500 bees-per-frame benchmark), calculates your total brood area in square inches, and produces an overall Colony Health Score out of 100. A colour-coded Varroa status badge tells you at a glance whether your mite levels are safe, require monitoring, or demand immediate treatment. The calculator also generates a plain-English insight explaining exactly what your numbers mean and what action to take next.

### 🍯 Honey Yield Estimator
Enter the number of honey supers, frames per super, average fill level, frame type (deep, medium, or shallow), and current nectar flow conditions. The calculator applies established honey-per-frame benchmarks — 6.5 lbs for a deep frame, 4.5 lbs for medium, 3.0 lbs for shallow — adjusted for seasonal flow multipliers to give you a realistic yield forecast in both pounds and kilograms. It then converts that figure into the number of standard 12oz jars and estimates the market value of your harvest at average retail prices. A live visual rendering of your supers shows frame fill levels at a glance.

### 🌿 Feeding Calculator
Select your colony size, feeding purpose (stimulative feeding, winter preparation, emergency feeding, or new package), feed type (1:1 syrup, 2:1 syrup, fondant, or pollen substitute), and the number of days you plan to feed. HiveKeeper calculates the exact weight of sugar required, the volume of water needed to mix it, the total syrup output in quarts, and how frequently you should refill the feeder. A Winter Stores Adequacy meter tracks how close your current honey stores are to the recommended 60–80 lbs needed for safe overwintering, with colour-coded warnings if stores are critically low.

### 🔄 Swarm Risk Assessor
Swarm prevention is one of the most important — and most overlooked — aspects of hive management. This calculator combines hard data (frame congestion percentage, queen age, and time of year) with five observable warning signs you can tick off during an inspection (queen cells, beard clustering, lack of empty comb, excess drones, and heightened activity). HiveKeeper scores your swarm risk from 0 to 100, displays a risk badge (Low / Moderate / High), estimates how many days you have before action becomes critical, and gives you a prioritised action plan tailored to your specific risk level.

### 📋 Inspection Checklist Generator
Choose your inspection type — Routine Weekly Check, Spring Build-Up, Pre-Winter Assessment, Disease & Mite Check, or Queen-Right Check — and HiveKeeper generates a complete, task-specific checklist covering everything you should look for during that inspection. Each checklist item includes a brief expert explanation of what to look for and why it matters. Tasks are interactive checkboxes you can tick off as you go. The tool also tells you whether your inspection is on schedule, overdue, or ahead of time based on how many days have passed since your last visit, and recommends when to return.

## Who Should Use HiveKeeper?

**Beginner beekeepers** will find HiveKeeper especially valuable during the first two to three years of keeping, when it's hard to know whether what you're seeing in a hive is normal or cause for concern. The plain-English insights turn raw numbers into clear, actionable guidance — removing the guesswork from decisions like when to feed, when to treat for varroa, or whether your colony is strong enough to overwinter.

**Hobbyist beekeepers** managing one to ten hives can use HiveKeeper to bring more structure and consistency to their inspections, track honey yield expectations across the season, and plan feeding and treatment schedules with precision rather than guesswork.

**Small-scale apiarists** will appreciate the ability to quickly run yield and feeding calculations across multiple hives, and use the swarm risk tool proactively to prevent costly swarm losses before the spring build-up peaks.

**Beekeeping students and course attendees** can use HiveKeeper as a practical companion to classroom learning — translating the theory of colony dynamics, varroa management, and seasonal feeding into real numbers based on their own hive conditions.

**Experienced beekeepers** can use it as a quick sanity-check tool, a teaching aid for mentees, or a time-saving calculator for the more tedious arithmetic involved in feeding ratios and yield forecasting.

## Why It Matters

Most beekeeping decisions — when to treat, when to feed, when to add space, when to split — come down to numbers: frame counts, mite percentages, weight of stores, days since last inspection. HiveKeeper turns those numbers into decisions, so you spend less time second-guessing and more time doing what matters: keeping your bees healthy and your hives productive.
